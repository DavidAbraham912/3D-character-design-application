# 3D-character-design-application
3D character design application with OpenGL, C ++ (Maya application simulation)
-The application uses OpenGL Api graphics with libraries for OpenGl like Glut, Glew
- Save temporary data to .txt file, save main data to Sql Server
- Use algorithms, geometry,matrices and quaternion to translate and transform vertes
- Export 3D characters into vertices arrays and save in file .txt,that can be displayed in games using OpenGL API
- The problem of translate, transform, rounded corners, ... You must use math and geometry to do it. So, the application is fast or slow, beautiful or bad .All in the algorithm, not API.
- API and library only support to show Object. It not caculating for you

- We can use 3D graphic,2D graphic or 2D and 3D graphic to design Object

- To translate object,vertices,line or face we click choice button translate to show 3 arrow and 3 square like this.Mouse down on arrow(or square) and drag(still hold mouse) to translate.

+ To rotate object,vertices,line or face we click choice button translate to show 3 circle like this.Mouse down on circle and drag(still hold mouse) to rotate.

- And same to scale

- To choice object,vertices,line or face we click on them or drag mouse to create a rectangular selection

- Rounded corners, why not?
